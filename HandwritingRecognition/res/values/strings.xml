    <string name="help">This app demonstrates the principle of the naive Bayes classifier.\n If it is the first time you use this app, its database is empty and you should teach it some samples.\n 1. Write a digit on the screen and touch the corresponding button to let the app learn a sample.\n 2. After the app learns some samples, you can write a digit and touch \"Recognize\" to let the app tell you which digit you have written.\n 3. Let the app learn more samples and you will see: The more samples it learns, the cleverer it will be.</string>
